# Tree Intersection

## Features

Write a function that LEFT JOINs two hashmaps into a single data structure.

- Write a function called left join
- Arguments: two hash maps
  - The first parameter is a hashmap that has word strings as keys, and a synonym of the key as values.
  - The second parameter is a hashmap that has word strings as keys, and antonyms of the key as values.
- Return: The returned data structure that holds the results is up to you. It doesn’t need to exactly match the output below, so long as it achieves the LEFT JOIN logic
-
NOTES:

- Combine the key and corresponding values (if they exist) into a new data structure according to LEFT JOIN logic.
- LEFT JOIN means all the values in the first hashmap are returned, and if values exist in the “right” hashmap, they are appended to the result row.
- If no values exist in the right hashmap, then some flavor of NULL should be appended to the result row.

## Approach & Efficiency

- Big O Time Complexity is O(n) due to the traversal of the synonyms map. It is also O(n) for space complexity.
