# Hash Table Implementation

## Features

Implement a Hashtable Class with the following methods:

- set
  - Arguments: key, value
  - Returns: nothing
  - This method should hash the key, and set the key and value pair in the table, handling collisions as needed.
  - Should a given key already exist, replace its value from the value argument given to this method.
- get
  - Arguments: key
  - Returns: Value associated with that key in the table
- has
  - Arguments: key
  - Returns: Boolean, indicating if the key exists in the table already.
- keys
  - Returns: Collection of keys
- hash
  - Arguments: key
  - Returns: Index in the collection for that key

## Whiteboard Process

No whiteboard was created for this class implementation.

## Approach & Efficiency

- set(key, value): O(1) average case, O(n) worst case
- get(key): O(1) average case, O(n) worst case
- has(key): O(1) average case, O(n) worst case
- keys(): O(n)
- hash(key): O(1)
