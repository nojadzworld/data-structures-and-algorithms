# Linked List Insertions

## Features

Write the following methods for the Linked List class:

- kth from end
  - argument: a number, `k`, as a parameter.
  - Return the nodeâ€™s value that is `k` places from the tail of the linked list.
  - You have access to the Node class and all the properties on the Linked List class as well as the methods created in previous challenges.

## Approach & Efficiency

 - we use two pointers - slow and fast - to traverse the Linked List. Initially, both pointers point to the head of the Linked List.
   Then, we move the fast pointer k positions ahead of the slow pointer.
   If the fast pointer reaches the end of the Linked List before moving k positions,
   we know that k is larger than the size of the Linked List and we throw an exception.

- Once we have moved the fast pointer k positions ahead, we start moving both pointers - slow and fast - one position at a time until the fast pointer reaches the end of the Linked List.
- At this point, the slow pointer will be pointing to the node that is k positions from the tail of the Linked List, and we return the value of that node.

I ran out of time trying to get the tests to pass.
