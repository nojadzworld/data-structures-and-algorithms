# Stacks and Queues Pseudo

## Features

### Stack

- Create a new class called pseudo queue.
  - Do not use an existing Queue.
  - Instead, this PseudoQueue class will implement our standard queue interface (the two methods listed below),
  - Internally, utilize 2 Stack instances to create and manage the queue
- Methods:
  - enqueue
    - Arguments: value
    - Inserts a value into the PseudoQueue, using a first-in, first-out approach.
  - dequeue
    - Arguments: none
    - Extracts a value from the PseudoQueue, using a first-in, first-out approach.

***NOTE**: The `Stack` instances have only `push`, `pop`, and `peek` methods. You should use your own Stack implementation. Instantiate these Stack objects in your PseudoQueue constructor.*

## Approach & Efficiency
- `enqueue` The time complexity for the enqueue method in the PseudoQueue implementation using two stacks is O(n) where n is the number of elements in the queue. This is because the method needs to move all elements from one stack to another before adding the new element to the queue. However, the worst-case scenario only occurs when the stack with all the elements has to be moved to the other stack.
- The space complexity for the `enqueue` method is O(n) since the method creates a new stack with size n to hold all the elements.
- `dequeue` The time complexity for the dequeue method in the PseudoQueue implementation using two stacks is O(1). This is because the method only needs to pop the top element from stack1.
- The space complexity for the `dequeue` method is O(1) because the method does not create any new data structures.
