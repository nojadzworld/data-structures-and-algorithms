## Approach & Efficiency

We iterate over the input list of city names, find the corresponding vertices in the graph, check if a direct edge exists between each pair of consecutive cities, and calculate the total cost of the trip. If at any point we can't find a city in the graph or a direct flight to the next city, we return null.
